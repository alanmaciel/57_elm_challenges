# Saying Hello

The "Hello World" program is the first program you learn on many languages, but
it doesn't involve any input.

So create a program that prompts for your name and prints a greeting using your
name.

## Example Output

What is your name? Alan
Hello, Alan, nice to meet you!

## Constraint

- Keep the input, string concatenation, and output separate.

## Challenges

- Write a new version of the program without using any variables.
- Write a version of the program that displays different greetings for different
people.
